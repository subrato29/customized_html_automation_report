- This report is 100% user-defined written in groovy, I have designed from scratch and invoked in a groovy based automation framework. 
- This good part is that, this report could be interated to any framework written in groovy or java.
- After every execution end, the framework generates 2 level of reporting.
- 1st level- Expose test suite level performance, e.g. how many testcase passed/failed.
- 2nd level- Expose test steps level performance, e.g. which steps of a testcase get passed/failed.
- Also screenshot of failure validation is attached with concerned failure steps.
