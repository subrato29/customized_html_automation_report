- This is the report I have designed from scratch. to a java based automation framework, I have designed. 
- This report could be interated to any java based framework.
- After every execution end, the framework generates 2 level of reporting.
- 1st level- Expose test suite level performance, e.g. how many testcase passed/failed.
- 2nd level- Expose test steps level performance, e.g. which steps of a testcase get passed/failed.
- Also screenshot of failure validation is attached with concerned failure steps.
